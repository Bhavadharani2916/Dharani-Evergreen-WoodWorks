        Wood is the material most often used for making furniture. <br>
        Although there are over a hundred different kinds that <br> be used for furniture,>
        some woods have natural properties that make them superior<BR> to the others.
        A relatively cheap material, wood lends itself to various<br> kinds of treatment;
        for example, it can be stained, painted, gilded, and glued. <br>
        It can be shaped by means of hand- or power-operated cutting<br> and drilling tools. Heated,<br>
        it can be bent to a certain extent into a predetermined shape <br> and thereafter will retain the shape.<br>
        The grain in wood creates a structure with varying character,<br> which in itself provides a natural ornamental
        surface,<br>
        in which patterns can be formed by means of precalculated juxtapositions.<br> Colours range from white, yellow,
        green, red, brown, <br>
        gray to black through countless intermediary tones. By juxtaposing wood of<br> different colours, extremely rich
        effects<br>
        have been achieved, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries. Wood, <br>if stored under favourable conditions,
        is durable,<br>
        and pieces of furniture from the oldest civilizations—Egypt, for example—are still extant.<br>
        Lastly, most wood has an aromatic scent.<br>
